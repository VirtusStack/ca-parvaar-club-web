        dedicated to CA (Chartered Accountants) their families/employees/friends

      <p>
        I wish to express my gratitude for your valuable support and positive
        response from time to time which has motivated UPACA Gurukul, the World's
        1st one-stop educational facility to do better and better for the
        Chartered Accountant's Education and to take it to a higher echelon.
        In relation to this and motivated by the philosophy of our inspiration,
        CA Uttam Prakash Agarwalji to further develop the Fraternity of Chartered
        Accountants as a whole, I proudly announce the concept of CA Pariwar Club.

  	right into the refreshing lap of nature our services have been aptly titled as
  	Rediscover Yourself. With user friendly options of Family/
  	Corporate memberships & prestigious agreements with elite clubs Pan India,
  	CA. Pariwar Club too has received a very positive and good response like UPACA
  	Gurukul. We have been affiliated with Resorts and Clubs across multiple states
  	and cities and are in the process of expanding our reach further vide more
  	affiliations to facilitate our Club Members.
      </p>

      <p>
  	Apart from developing a leisure destination for CA. fraternity, their
  	families/employees/friends & citizens alike, CA. Pariwar Club also solicits a
  	basic concept – to divert the proceeds generated for funding & supporting other
  	meaningful causes. These include educational causes such as providing financial
  	aid to students having potential but lacking financial sources, scholarships to
  	meritorious students, education of girl child etc. & social causes such as
  	aiding economically weaker sections, uplifting girl child, sponsoring (& thus –
  	developing) backward areas etc.
     </p>

     <p>
  	CA. Pariwar Club is all set to carve a niche for itself, not just on national but
  	international levels. Spread on the pages spanning this website is information
  	that has been placed for your perusal at length. It gives me immense pleasure to
  	invite you to be a part of this unique venture & grow with it. You inadvertently
  	support a noble cause while you enjoy with us or our affiliated clubs/ resorts.
  	Looking forward to your continued support and best wishes.
    </p>

     <p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

     <p>
  	<strong>Yours Truly,</strong><br>
  	For CA Pariwar Club & Hospitalities Pvt. Ltd.<br>
